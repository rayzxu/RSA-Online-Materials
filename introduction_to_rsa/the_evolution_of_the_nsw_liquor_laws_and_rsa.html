			<section id="content_body">
				<p>Governments recognise the negative impact that alcohol can have on the community. As a result, the sale and supply of alcohol is appropriately controlled. Sanctions apply where licensed premises are poorly run and irresponsible serving occurs — such as intoxication and people under 18 years of age (minors) obtaining alcohol.</p>
				<p>RSA has been part of the State’s liquor laws for more than 100 years.</p>
				<p>There have been many significant amendments made to the liquor laws over the past 20 years in response to changing community attitudes and Government policy regarding the sale and supply of alcohol.</p>
				<p>Some of the most significant changes occurred in 1996 when the liquor laws were changed to introduce ‘harm minimisation’ (ie. minimising the harm associated with the misuse and abuse of alcohol) as one of the key purposes of the liquor laws. The move to a harm minimisation approach in the liquor laws followed increasing concern about the extent of alcohol-related crime and violence — particularly in and around licensed premises.</p>
				<p>In 2008, a new Liquor Act commenced, further strengthening harm minimisation controls applying to the sale and consumption of alcohol.</p>
				<p>In 2009, a new scheme was introduced that applies special conditions and restrictions on licensed premises that have high levels of alcohol-related violent incidents.</p>
				<p>In 2012, the Three Strikes disciplinary scheme commenced, which enables a strike to be imposed on licensed premises where serious liquor law offences are committed. This includes permitting intoxication and underage alcohol supply on licensed premises.</p>
				<p>Amendments to the liquor laws in 2012 and 2014 established a regulatory framework that imposes special conditions on licensed premises in ‘precincts’ with unacceptably high levels of alcohol-related violence. Licensed premises in the Sydney CBD and Kings Cross precincts are subject to these requirements.</p>
				<p>In late 2014, further harm minimisation reforms were introduced, including an escalating sanctions regime for selling alcohol to minors, and enabling the Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority to suspend or revoke a person’s RSA certification where a person has not met their responsible serving obligations.</p>
				<p>In March 2015, <em>Prevention of Intoxication on Licensed Premises</em> guidelines were issued to assist licensees comply with the liquor laws and better manage the risk of intoxication.</p>
				<p>A risk based licence fee scheme applies from 2015, whereby licensees pay an annual risk-based licence fee that reflects the level of risk to the community.</p>
				<p>These reforms support a harm minimisation approach – which emphasises responsible service and consumption of alcohol and the responsible operation of licensed premises. Harm minimisation is justified on public health and safety grounds, given the impact irresponsible alcohol consumption can have on local communities, road safety and public health.</p>
				<p>The protection of local amenity is an important factor to be considered. Alcohol-related violence, crime and noise disturbances are likely to erode the quality of life for people living or working in the vicinity of licensed premises.</p>
				<p>The liquor laws require patrons of licensed premises to behave responsibly. Penalties apply where intoxicated or violent persons fail to leave licensed premises when requested, or where they attempt to re-enter licensed premises after being ejected.</p>
				<p>RSA training is mandatory for everyone in NSW involved in the sale and supply of alcohol to the public. This includes licensees, club secretaries, service staff and security staff working at licensed premises. There are no exemptions from undertaking the course.</p>
				<p>RSA training also applies to volunteers, promotional staff and contract employees, as well as directors of registered clubs who have alcohol service responsibilities, such as duty directors in small registered clubs.</p>
				<p>Sanctions apply to liquor licensees and to staff who serve alcohol or undertake security duties where RSA training has not been undertaken.</p>
