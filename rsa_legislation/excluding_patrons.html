				<h2>Refusal of entry and patron bans/barring</h2>
				<p>Licensees have a right to refuse entry or evict a person from their licensed premises. Under both the liquor laws and common law, a number of options are available to licensees to deal with troublesome patrons – ranging from refusing entry or removing a person at the time of the incident, barring the person for an extended period of time (from single or multiple premises), or requesting a banning order be issued against the person.</p>
				<p>Care should be taken to ensure that when a person is refused entry or ejected from the licensed premises, either under the liquor laws or by common law, it is consistent with the NSW <em>Anti-Discrimination Act 1977</em> and NSW and Commonwealth discrimination laws.</p>
				<p><em>Refusal of Entry and Patron Bans/Barring</em> guidelines have been published by the Office of Liquor, Gaming & Racing to help licensees identify the best approach to deal with troublesome patrons, including those who are disruptive, violent, intoxicated, or who fail to follow the rules of licensed premises. The guidelines include step-by-step instructions for implementing these strategies, including instructions and resources for adopting a multi-venue barring strategy known as a "barred from one, barred from all" policy within a local liquor accord.</p>
				<p>These guidelines are available at: <a href="http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/accords_patron_barring.asp">www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/accords_patron_barring.asp.</a></p>

				<h2>Liquor Act 2007</h2>
				<p>The licensee, their staff or security can refuse to admit or ask any person to leave the licensed premises:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>who is intoxicated, violent, quarrelsome or disorderly;</li>
					<li>whose presence renders the licensee liable to a penalty under the Act;</li>
					<li>who smokes within a smoke free area; or</li>
					<li>who uses or possesses a prohibited drug while on the premises.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Any person who is refused entry or asked to leave in the above circumstances can be barred by the licensee indefinitely.</p>
				<p>If a person is refused entry or ejected from licensed premises because they are intoxicated, violent, quarrelsome or disorderly, or for smoking in a smoke free area, or for possessing or using an illicit substance, an offence is committed if they:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>attempt to re-enter the premises within 24 hours;</li>
					<li>remain in the vicinity of the premises (ie. within a radius of 50 metres from the boundary of the licensed premises) without a reasonable excuse, such as waiting for transport, fearing for their safety or the person resides in the vicinity; or</li>
					<li>re-enter the vicinity of the premises within six hours without a reasonable excuse.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A maximum court fine of $5,500 applies. Police and Office of Liquor, Gaming & Racing inspectors also have the option of issuing a $550 penalty notice.</p>
				<p>If police are continually called to the same premises to assist in removing drunken patrons or enforcing the fail to leave offence, a disciplinary complaint can be taken on the ground that intoxicated persons have frequently been on the premises, or have been seen frequently leaving the premises.</p>
				<p>In these instances, police could obtain evidence to determine whether the patron was intoxicated while alcohol was still being served to that person, and what steps, if any, were taken at the time by staff to remove the patron. This enables police to consider taking disciplinary action against the licensed premises (or its staff) for intoxication offences, or action against the patron for failing to leave.</p>

				<h2>Banning orders</h2>
				<p>While barring strategies are generally sufficient to deal with disruptive patrons, licensees also have the option to apply for a formal banning order.</p>
				<p>These orders can mean that a person who has been repeatedly intoxicated, violent, quarrelsome or disorderly on or in the immediate vicinity of licensed premises can be banned for up to six months from multiple licensed premises.</p>
				<p>The Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority determines whether or not to make a banning order. Applications for a banning order may be made by the Secretary, Department of Justice, NSW Police, or a licensee who is a local liquor accord member. A person named in a banning order must not enter, attempt to enter or remain on, the licensed premises.</p>

				<h2>Sydney CBD and Kings Cross precincts banning orders</h2>
				<p>Police can issue troublemakers with a temporary banning order that applies for up to 48 hours, preventing them from entering most licensed premises in the precincts. Long-term banning orders can be issued by the Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority for up to 12 months in more serious cases.</p>

				<h2>Voluntary exclusions</h2>
				<p>The liquor laws allow people with a drinking problem to voluntarily exclude themselves from licensed premises.</p>
				<p>The person enters an agreement with the licensee allowing the licensee, or a responsible member of staff, to prevent the patron from entering the licensed premises. Licensees are obliged to comply with a request for self-exclusion from licensed premises.</p>

				<h2>Common law</h2>
				<p>The liquor laws recognise a licensee’s common law right to exclude or evict a person from their licensed premises. Under common law, a patron has an implied licence to enter and remain on the premises – which the licensee can revoke at any time.</p>
				<p>Common examples of the use of these rights is through the enforcement of dress codes, voluntary lock outs or barring patrons for behaviour which occurred at another premises or outside the venue. Essentially, licensees can revoke a person’s implied common law invitation to enter the premises for any reason, provided it is not discriminatory.</p>
				<p>If a patron refuses to comply with a common law request to leave a venue, they are committing an offence under the <em>Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901</em>, and could also be exposed to civil liability for trespass.</p>
