							<p>When officers conduct covert operations throughout venues, the intoxicated person that creates the offence, is what a normal person would view to be completely over and above the normal intoxicated state.</p>
							<p>That is to say that a normal person would look across and see someone staggering, asleep, falling off his chair—that is the type of person that the officers are looking for when conducting covert operations, in terms of intoxication.</p>
							<p>It is not what the general public would know as having a good time on licensed premises and consuming a number of alcoholic drinks. So there is some comfort there to the industry that it is not a narrow view, it is a broad view of the level that constitutes the definition of intoxication.</p>
						</section>

				<h2>Intoxication defined</h2>
				<p>Intoxication is defined to assist industry comply with their responsible serving obligations and enhance enforcement efforts by police and inspectors.</p>
				<p>A person is considered to be intoxicated if:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the person’s speech, balance, coordination or behaviour is noticeably affected; and</li>
					<li>it is reasonable, in the circumstances, to believe that the affected speech, balance, coordination or behaviour is the result of the consumption of alcohol.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The Secretary, Department of Justice, has issued guidelines to assist the industry to determine whether a person may be intoxicated. These guidelines are available from the Office of Liquor, Gaming &amp; Racing at <a href="http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/liquor_fact_sheets.asp">www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/liquor_fact_sheets.asp.</a></p>

				<p>The noticeable signs of intoxication include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Speech</strong> - The person is slurring words, talking in rambling or unintelligible sentences, incoherent or muddled speech.</li>
					<li><strong>Balance</strong> – The person is unsteady on their feet, is stumbling or bumping into people or objects, is swaying uncontrollably or cannot stand or walk straight. </li>
					<li><strong>Coordination</strong> – The person may be (for example) fumbling to light a cigarette, having difficulty in counting money or paying, spilling or dropping drinks, having difficulty in opening or closing doors.</li>
					<li><strong>Behaviour</strong> – The person is rude, aggressive, or offensive, is unable to concentrate or follow instructions, is boisterous or is pestering other patrons.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These guidelines recognise the need to form a reasonable belief that the person is intoxicated as a result of alcohol consumption. The guidelines also recognise that some medical conditions, disabilities or the use of drugs may cause similar behaviours without the person being intoxicated as a result of consuming alcohol.</p>

				<h2>Intoxication laws</h2>
				<p>If an intoxicated person is detected on the licensed premises, the licensee is taken to have permitted intoxication, unless it is proven that the licensee or staff:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>refused to serve the intoxicated person any more alcohol;</li>
					<li>asked the intoxicated person to leave the premises; and</li>
					<li>contacted, or attempted to contact, the police for assistance in removing the person.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Alternatively, a licensee would need to prove that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>they took all of the steps set out in guidelines issued by the Secretary, Department of Justice, relating to the prevention of intoxication on licensed premises; or</li>
					<li>the intoxicated person did not consume alcohol on the licensed premises.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Guidelines have been issued by the Secretary, Department of Justice, that include practical steps that licensees can take to manage the risk of intoxication. The guidelines are available at <a href="http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/liquor_preventing_intoxication.asp">www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/liquor_preventing_intoxication.asp</a></p>

				<p>Intoxication offences can also result in a strike being incurred by licensed premises under the three strikes disciplinary scheme. Where three strikes are incurred within three years, a licence can be suspended or cancelled (see section 2.4 for further information about the three strikes scheme).</p>

							<p>Practical steps, I guess apart from observation and just being out and about and knowing who’s in the venue, we also have our house policy that means that we do have food available at all times, that we have water available at all times, we have a water cooler as well as if anybody comes to the bar and asks for a glass of water it’s free, of course, as is required. We also have a water cooler in the venue that people can access at any time so that even if the bar is very busy people don’t have to wait in line to get a water, they can just go straight over the water cooler and access that.</p>
							<p>We obviously have a range of different drink styles available so non-alcoholic drinks, low alcoholic drinks, mid-strength drinks are available. At certain times of the week, certain times of the day or the evening, we have drink restrictions that we put into practice, so on a Friday night, for instance, where we have a capacity crowd, it’s difficult for the staff to actually see past the first three rows of people at the bar that are wanting drinks, so they’re not in a position to be able to see who those drinks are going back to if there is a shout of drinks, so we have a policy that we don’t serve shots or we don’t serve doubles and we don’t serve jugs after a certain time.</p>
