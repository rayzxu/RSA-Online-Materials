					<p>Serious problems can occur when licensed premises operate unlawfully and irresponsibly. These problems can affect the licensed premises, the neighbourhood, patrons and the community.</p>
				</div>

			<section id="content_body">
				<p>Problems at licensed premises can be linked to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>lack of understanding by the licensee and staff of trading entitlements and obligations;</li>
					<li>licensed premises being operated unlawfully eg. selling alcohol outside authorised trading hours;</li>
					<li>irresponsible serving practices;</li>
					<li>poor patron behaviour (which is often an outcome of irresponsible practices); and</li>
					<li>lack of proper management and control of the licensed premises (which can lead to irresponsible serving practices and poor patron behaviour).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>What powers do the authorities have to ensure that licensed premises conduct their business responsibly?</p>
				<p>The NSW Police Force, the Secretary, Department of Justice, and local councils can take action to deal with serious alcohol-related problems that have an adverse impact on the community.</p>
				<p>The Secretary, Department of Justice, can investigate complaints made by police, councils, residents and others, and impose conditions including trading hour restrictions and entry curfews.</p>
				<p>Non-compliance with the liquor laws can be dealt with in several ways. At a basic level, OLGR or police can engage with licensed premises to provide assistance and advice on improving compliance. At the next level, licensees and their staff can be subject to action under the liquor laws, including the issuing of a penalty notice where offences are committed. Finally, disciplinary action can be taken by the Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority that can result in the suspension or cancellation of a liquor licence.</p>

				<h2>Noise and disturbance complaints</h2>
				<p>Police, councils, and residents can make a complaint about licensed premises noise or disturbance to the Secretary, Department of Justice.</p>
				<p>Many noise and disturbance complaints stem from serious problems relating to the management and operation of the licensed premises, or violent, anti-social or criminal activity involving patrons in the vicinity of the premises. Disturbances and criminal activity, including violence, involving patrons can often be linked back to their levels of intoxication and the serving practices of the premises.</p>
				<p>Where a complaint is established, conditions can be imposed on licensed premises to ensure the venue does not impact on the local amenity, including conditions relating to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>noise emission restrictions;</li>
					<li>additional security;</li>
					<li>a reduction in trading hours/entertainment; and</li>
					<li>drink and patron entry restrictions.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="round_block;">

				</div>

				<h2>Disciplinary complaints</h2>
				<p>The Secretary, Department of Justice, local councils and the police can lodge a disciplinary complaint with the Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority on a number of grounds, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a breach of licence conditions;</li>
					<li>the licence not being exercised in the public interest —  e.g. allowing patrons to conduct irresponsible drinking competitions;</li>
					<li>intoxicated persons frequently being on or seen leaving the premises;</li>
					<li>the licensee/manager engaging in activities likely to encourage alcohol abuse — e.g. irresponsible alcohol promotions such as all you can drink offers; and</li>
					<li>acts of violence involving patrons frequently occurring on or near the premises.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Where a disciplinary complaint is upheld, sanctions can be imposed, including penalties of up to $55,000 and the cancellation or suspension of the licence.</p>

				<h2>Short-term closure of licensed premises</h2>
				<p>The Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority, a magistrate, registrar of a Local Court or an authorised employee of the Department of Justice can order the closure of licensed premises for up to 72 hours where it is considered there is a threat to public health or safety, a risk of serious property damage, a significant threat to the environment or a risk of serious offences being committed on the premises.</p>
				<p>An application for a short-term closure of licensed premises can be made by the Secretary, Department of Justice or Commissioner of Police. The short-term closure provisions are used to address serious alcohol-related incidents, such as brawls and violence, as well as drug dealing and other criminal activity occurring on licensed premises.</p>
				<p>In more extreme cases, closure orders can be made for up to six months.</p>

				<h2>Alcohol restrictions for violent licensed premises (violent venues scheme)</h2>
				<p>Licensed premises with high levels of violent incidents are subject to a graduated system of restrictions. The restrictions apply where 12 or more violent incidents have been attributed to the licensed premises in 12 months.</p>
				<p>Special licence conditions include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>submission of a licensed premises safety plan setting out how the venue will reduce the risk of alcohol-related violence;</li>
					<li>mandatory 1:30am lock out of patrons (which prevents the entry or re-entry of patrons to the premises);</li>
					<li>no alcohol served 30 minutes prior to closing;</li>
					<li>no glass containers to be used after midnight;</li>
					<li>a ban on “shots” and other limits on drinks after midnight;</li>
					<li>ten minute alcohol time-outs every hour after midnight or active distribution of water and/or food; and</li>
					<li>extra security measures.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The list of licensed premises subject to these special licence conditions is updated twice a year, on 1 June (relating to incidents that occurred in the previous calendar year) and 1 December (relating to incidents attributable in the previous financial year).</p>
				<p>From 2016, where a licensed premises appeared on the list of violent venues in the previous calendar year, a compliance risk loading of up to $9,000, as well as a patron capacity loading of up to $8,000, and a $2,000 location risk loading (for premises located in the Sydney CBD and Kings Cross precincts) apply under the risk based licence fee scheme.</p>

				<h2>Kings Cross and Sydney CBD Entertainment precincts alcohol restrictions</h2>
				<p>Special licence conditions apply to licensed premises in both the Sydney CBD Entertainment and the Kings Cross precinct.</p>
				<p>The restrictions that apply to licensed premises in these precincts include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lock outs and last drinks: a 1.30am lock out and the cessation of alcohol sales at 3am applies at hotels, registered clubs, nightclubs and licensed karaoke bars. Small bars (maximum 60 people), most restaurants and tourism accommodation establishments are exempt. </li>
					<li>Drink restrictions: Certain types of drinks must not be sold or supplied after midnight until closing, or for premises authorised to trade for 24 hours, until 7am. These include shots, drinks containing more than 50% spirits or liqueur, any ‘ready to drink’ beverage containing more than 5% alcohol, and any drink prepared on the premises containing more than 30ml of spirits or liqueur.</li>
					<li>Temporary bans: Police can issue troublemakers with a temporary banning order that applies for up to 48 hours, preventing them from entering most licensed premises in the precincts. Long term banning orders can be issued by the Independent Liquor & Gaming Authority for up to 12 months in more serious cases.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Further information about the restrictions applying in these precincts is available at:</p>

				</ul>

				<h2>Three Strikes disciplinary scheme for licensed premises</h2>
				<p>The Three Strikes scheme allows strikes to be imposed where a licensee or an approved manager of the licensed premises is convicted of one of a range of serious offences under the liquor laws, including permitting intoxication, or selling or supplying alcohol to an intoxicated person or a minor.</p>
				<p>A first strike is automatically incurred upon conviction for a single offence and is active for three years from the date of the offence. </p>
				<p>A second strike can be imposed upon conviction, payment of a penalty notice or the issue of an enforcement order for a further offence committed within three years of the first offence.</p>
				<p>Licence conditions may be imposed when a first or second strike is incurred.</p>
				<p>A third strike can result in the imposition of licence conditions, licence suspension for up to 12 months, licence cancellation and a moratorium on a new liquor licence being granted for the same business operators at the premises for up to 12 months, and/or disqualification of a licensee for any period of time.</p>
				<p>For registered clubs, a third strike can result in the imposition of licence conditions, disqualification of a club secretary, dismissal of any or all of the club directors, and/or the appointment of an administrator to manage the club.</p>
				<p>From 2016, where a strike is in force as at 15 March each year, licensees must also pay a $3,000 compliance risk loading, as well as a patron capacity loading of up to $8,000, and a $2,000 location risk loading (for premises located in the Sydney CBD and Kings Cross precincts).</p>
