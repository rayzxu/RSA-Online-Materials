							<p>For a start, we have signage around the place, as prescribed, and again we’re a food-based business so we have a large part of the hotel devoted to an area where minors are allowed to enter. The restricted area is about one-third of the hotel and that leaves two-thirds for the other. A portion of that is for gaming which is also restricted.</p>
							<p>So we have the defined areas, we have signage in those areas, and then we rely heavily on supervision of our staff and our managers to patrol those areas and to be observant. The hotel is set up in such a way that we have good visibility of all areas from the bar, and we also probably carry a heavier staff list, that is more people employed at any one time, than a lot of hotels do, which gives us the opportunity to supervise. So we can supervise the age of the people, the behaviour of the people, their level of intoxication, and any behaviour which we think is not suitable or trending in that direction, so it’s pretty much a hands-on thing.</p>
							<p>As well as that, we have cameras but they’re really there to record and to check back or to support our action if need be. Really it’s a matter of on-floor supervision. That’s how we do it.</p>

				<h2>Entry into licensed premises</h2>
				<p>All licensed premises should check <a href="rsa_legislation/evidence_of_age.html">evidence of age</a> documentation to ensure that patrons being served or supplied alcohol are over 18 years of age.</p>

				<h3>Hotels</h3>
				<p>While most parts of a hotel are a bar area (and minors are not permitted under any circumstances in these areas), there are some areas where a minor can enter, provided certain conditions are met.</p>
				<p>For instance, an unaccompanied minor is allowed to be in the dining room of a hotel, or in the accommodation area of the hotel. The hotel may also have an area known as a minors area approved for use by minors (in the company of a <a href="rsa_legislation/responsible_adult.html">responsible adult</a>) such as a bistro or lounge area.</p>

				<h3>Registered clubs</h3>
				<p>Minors are prohibited from being in certain parts of a registered club such as bar and gaming machine areas. However, like hotels, there are circumstances where minors may be in a registered club if certain conditions are met.</p>
				<p>A registered club can obtain a:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>club functions authorisation – which allows minors and non-members to attend certain functions;</li>
					<li>junior members authorisation – which allows junior members to attend sporting-related activities or prize-giving ceremonies associated with sporting activities; and</li>
					<li>non-restricted area authorisation – which allows minors to enter a part or parts of the club.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A ‘walk through’ defence exists where a minor passes through a bar area in the company of a responsible adult to access another area of the hotel or club that the minor is lawfully allowed to enter.</p>

				<p>Other defences also include where the minor:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>is an apprentice or trainee and was in the bar area receiving trade training;</li>
					<li>was over 14 years of age, and produced to the licensee (or an employee or agent of the licensee) documentary evidence (eg. a driver licence or Photo Card) that could reasonably indicate that the minor was over 18 years of age; or</li>
					<li>was performing in a show or as part of a performance in the bar area and was in the company of a responsible adult.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Supply alcohol to a minor</h2>
				<p>There is a general prohibition on the supply of alcohol to a person who is under 18 years of age (a minor) in a licensed venue. In most instances, this prohibition also extends to private settings. In a licensed venue, those liable for the offence of supplying alcohol include the licensee, staff, and other patrons, including minors (where alcohol is supplied to other minors).</p>
				<p>Penalties of up to $11,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment (or $1,100 penalty notices) apply to adults convicted of underage alcohol supply offences. Minors are also liable for the offences of obtaining and drinking alcohol on licensed premises. These offences carry maximum court penalties of $2,200 (or a $220 penalty notice).</p>

				<p>Statutory defences for the offence of selling or supplying alcohol, or allowing alcohol to be sold or supplied, to a minor on licensed premises are available to a licensee in certain circumstances. The statutory defences are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>if the minor was over 14 years of age, and produced to the licensee (or an employee or agent of the licensee) documentary evidence (eg. a driver licence or a Photo Card) that could reasonably indicate that the minor was over 18 years of age; or</li>
					<li>if the alcohol is supplied to a minor by their parent or guardian.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The Three Strikes disciplinary scheme allows a liquor licence to be suspended or cancelled where alcohol is sold to a minor on licensed premises (see section 2.4 for details of this scheme). In addition, an escalating regime of sanctions also applies where the offence of selling alcohol to a minor has occurred on licensed premises, resulting in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a court conviction;</li>
					<li>payment of a penalty notice; or</li>
					<li>a penalty notice enforcement order is issued by the State Debt Recovery Office.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Significant sanctions apply, including automatic cancellation of a licence, where three offences occur in 12 months.</p>
				<p>For a first offence, a licensee is given the opportunity to explain to the Secretary, Department of Justice, why their licence should not be suspended for up to 28 days. In considering whether to suspend a licence, the Secretary may take into consideration the compliance history and other factors relating to the licensed premises.</p>
				<p>If a second offence is committed within 12 months of the first offence (and more than 28 days after the first offence), the licence is automatically suspended for 28 days.</p>
				<p>A licence is automatically cancelled and the licensee disqualified from holding a licence for 12 months where a third offence occurs more than 28 days after the second offence, but within 12 months of the first offence.</p>

				<h3>Second party sales</h3>
				<p>Second party sales occur when a person purchases alcohol on behalf of a minor. The person supplying the alcohol to the minor (either on licensed premises or elsewhere) is committing an offence which can attract fines of up to $11,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment (or a $1,100 penalty notice).</p>
				<p>It is a defence if the person who sold or supplied alcohol to a minor is the minor's parent or guardian, or if that person has been authorised to do so by the minor's parent or guardian. However, this defence does not apply to the sale or supply of alcohol on licensed premises.</p>

				<h3>Remote sales</h3>
				<p>The remote alcohol sales provisions of the liquor laws apply to alcohol sold to the public via the internet, telephone, facsimile and mail orders. These provisions recognise that remote alcohol sales, particularly online sales, are a potential source of supply for minors and that extra controls are needed.</p>
				<p>For remote alcohol sales, the law requires the display of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the liquor licence number in any published or electronic advertising; and</li>
					<li>the liquor licence number and the statutory notice (stating the offence of supplying alcohol to a minor) on the website where alcohol is being sold.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When taking a telephone, facsimile or mail order, the licensee must ensure that the prospective buyer provides a date of birth to confirm that the client is an adult (unless the details have been provided when placing a previous order).</p>
				<p>The licensee must give written instructions to the person delivering the order, such as a courier, requiring the alcohol to be delivered:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>to the adult who placed the order (include their name in the instructions);</li>
					<li>to another adult at the delivery address accepting the delivery on behalf of the adult who placed the order; or</li>
					<li>if the delivery is made on a day after the day the order is taken, or the sale was made online, in accordance with the customer's instructions (such as delivery to another address).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Maximum penalties of $2,200 apply if a licensee does not provide these written instructions. Maximum penalties of $3,300 apply to a person who requests a minor to take delivery of a remote sale. Maximum penalties of $2,200 apply if a minor takes delivery of a remote sale.</p>

				<h2>Minors selling and supplying alcohol</h2>
				<p>In most cases, the law prohibits minors from selling, supplying or serving alcohol on licensed premises. A minor cannot take an order for, or deliver, alcohol to patrons.</p>
				<p>The law does not stop minors from doing other things within areas of licensed premises where minors are permitted. This can include stocking shelves in a bottle shop or serving meals or taking food orders in a restaurant.</p>
				<p>The Independent Liquor & Gaming Authority can approve of a minor serving alcohol on licensed premises. However, approval would normally only be granted in very limited circumstances, and would be subject to stringent supervisory conditions. For example, approval may be given for a 17-year-old to work with their parent or guardian at certain times in an area of a hotel where minors are permitted.</p>
				<p>Maximum penalties of $5,500 apply to a licensee if a minor sells, supplies or serves alcohol without approval.</p>
