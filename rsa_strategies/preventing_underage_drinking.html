							<p>First of all, it’s a very very serious issue. Studies are now beginning to come out and show that the brain is still developing up to the age of 25 years of age, so they’re talking about zero tolerance to serving alcohol to minors even in a controlled environment, so again from a corporate responsibility and trying to service the community there is absolutely zero tolerance from our perspective in serving alcohol to minors.</p>
							<p>Ways that we try and monitor that is it’s monitoring, monitoring, monitoring, and that’s what we call ‘hardening the service areas’ so we ensure that all of our staff are trained in observation and in checking for ID and the certain kinds of IDs that we will and won’t accept. The IDs that we won’t accept are anything that don’t have a photo on it and that’s not a legal document obviously we won’t.</p>
							<p>Legally there’s an obligation that staff can refuse service to anybody that they believe is intoxicated or under age, but from our perspective our policy is that they call a duty manager and the duty manager will politely go up to that customer and ask for their identification under the auspices that we have a legal obligation to ensure that we don’t serve minors, and they’ll check for the ID. They’ll make sure that when they’re checking the ID, one, that they’re polite and courteous, as we are to all of our customers; we’ll ensure that it’s in a well-lit area; and we’ll ensure that the documentation has not been forged or tainted or changed in any way.</p>

							<p>You’re not allowed to be purchasing liquor if you’re under the age of 18, full stop. Anyone that walks into my store that looks anything under 25 I’ll ask for ID.</p>
							<p>The way that we limit minors coming into the store is by reducing the amount of ‘ready to drink’ or ‘alcopop’ style of drinks. My focus within the industry is not regarded as like mainstream; I’m tending more towards a fine wine selection of alcohols. I’m trying to increase my customer base which is lot more mature.</p>

				<p>It is essential that licensed premises focus on properly checking proof of age to prevent minors gaining access to alcohol.</p>
				<p>Licensees should adopt policies to check proof of age, such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>requiring any person appearing under 25 years of age to produce age identification;</li>
					<li>close scrutiny to check the authenticity of identification produced; and </li>
					<li>only accepting forms of identification recognised by the NSW liquor laws (which are outlined in 4.5 of this module).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>An incident register should be maintained to record instances where minors were refused entry to the premises, or where police were called because of concerns about the authenticity of the evidence of age produced.</p>
				<p>The information in the register can then be used to determine if the licensed premises' underage strategy is effective and, if needed, to take any necessary steps to improve the strategy. This may include joining a liquor accord or, if the licensee is already an accord member, raising the issue at the next accord meeting.</p>

				<h2>Saying 'no' to underage drinkers</h2>
				<p>Here are four basic steps that licensed premises can take to stop minors gaining access to alcohol.</p>

				<div class="tabs">
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#tab1">Step 1</a></li>
						<li><a href="#tab2">Step 2</a></li>
						<li><a href="#tab3">Step 3</a></li>
						<li><a href="#tab4">Step 4</a></li>
					</ul>
					<div id="tab1" class="cf">
						<div class="col col_2of3 tab_description">
							<h3>Step 1 - Be alert and proactive</h3>
							<p>Regular monitoring of the licensed premises and the vicinity of the premises. If there's a group of youngsters loitering outside, a quiet word will often be enough to send them on their way.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col col_1of3 tab_image_wrapper">

						</div>
					</div>
					<div id="tab2" class="cf">
						<div class="col col_2of3 tab_description">
							<h3>Step 2 - Stand your ground</h3>
							<p>Inform the customer that the liquor licence is at risk if alcohol is served to a minor. A refusal can embarrass a customer, so be tactful and professional. If faced with a group, move the person that is being spoken to away from the group.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<div id="tab3" class="cf">
						<div class="col col_2of3 tab_description">
							<h3>Step 3 - Avoid blame</h3>
							<p>Politely stress the legal obligations when refusing to serve someone or not allowing them on the premises. If asking for identification to establish a person’s age, confirm it's the policy of the premises to make this request of anyone where a person's age is in doubt.</p>

					<div id="tab4" class="cf">
						<div class="col col_2of3 tab_description">
							<h3>Step 4 - Ask for evidence of age</h3>
							<p>If you suspect someone of being underage, politely ask for identification – such as a NSW  Photo Card, a driver licence or a passport.</p>

				<h2>Preventing second party sales</h2>

				<p>It is unlawful to buy or obtain alcohol on behalf of a minor on licensed premises.</p>
				<p>It is often difficult to detect a second party sale. Therefore, care must be taken by staff to identify potential second party sales to prevent alcohol being supplied to minors.</p>
				<p>Let’s look at the actions staff can take to prevent second party sales.</p>

						<section class="transcript">
							<p>To prevent secondary sales—when you’ve been in the game long enough you’ll tend to notice the patterns—patterns being lots of $5 and $10 notes, silly drinks like Passion Pop, RTDs, alcopops, cask wines. You know, kids that come in shaking, that’s always the best one, if they come in and they’re doing this and they’ve got a fistful of $5 and $10 notes. ‘ID, please’ and then they show you the ID and then I’ll generally get one of the junior guys to finish the service and I’ll walk out the front and have a quick look to see what’s around, so before he even walks out the door I can say ‘Stop, here’s your money back, see you later’ and it works every time. They’re always within 20 metres of the front door.</p>

				<p>In NSW, parents and guardians cannot give permission for alcohol to be served to their underage children on licensed premises. Care must be taken to ensure that minors, including those in the company of a responsible adult, are not supplied alcohol on licensed premises.</p>
				<p>Watch how a waiter handles a request by a father to serve alcohol to his son who does not have appropriate evidence of age.</p>
